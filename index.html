            <p>in case it wasn't obvious, this website isn't anything serious. its just a testbed for writing code. this
                here is the testbed for scrolling, second page is the template, and datastorage is a test for webstorage
                (basicly cookies). some day I <em>might</em> use this template for something more serious, but for
                now...</p>

            <p> anyways, I've got a lot of space to fill since I removed the lorem ipsum that was here, so this section
                is gonna run on. one of my big hopes for my refreshed web dev skills is to make a full wiki for lisgar's
                space sim, since their current wiki hasn't been update since the 90's. the hard part is gonna be the
                page loading and linking, as you need to be able to make new pages from the browser. yipes. perhaps
                there's a library I could use to make that nightmare a bit simpler. after all, I know you can strap on
                other languages to handle more complicated logic, such as python or c#, that almost certainly can handle
                saving/loading. I wonder if .innerhtml could be used top put it all on one page using this.</p>
            <h1 id="section2">second section</h1>
            <p>this here is a second section, demonstrating internal navigation via linking. (scroll up, hit "second
                section" in the navbar)</p>
            <p>getting back to prior expirience, most of the quote-unquote skill I have with html actualy comes from
                xml, a config system wich uses html's powerful internal comunication to... well... configure things. its
                actualy pretty powerful. I last used it a few months ago, modyfying a game called "juno new origins" to
                use a block I made as part of its scripting language. somehow, it worked. I should probably follow up
                that project, actualy.
